# Four-in-a-row-super

"Four-In-A-Row super" is an application that allows to play Four-In-A-Row (FIAR) on a mobile device. Contrarily to most of the already existing applications on the market, where the only way to play is the basic FIAR, this application allows to play different modes :

1. Classic : the base game (common with all FIAR applications).
2. Popout : the Popout version, popularized by Hasbro in the 70’s.
3. Custom : where a set of custom new rules can be mixed together as the user wishes.

The idea of a FIAR game that’s combined with Power Ups and fancy behaviors comes from playing the game Chessplode (GooglePlay) which is a chess game where eating a pawn results in destroying all pawns in the same row and column. This application served as inspiration because it opened new possibilities for playing chess, namely having a more ’fun’ or ’arcade’ way to play, offering shorter and less serious games.
